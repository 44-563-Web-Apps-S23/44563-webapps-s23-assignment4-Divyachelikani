        ALTHEA THURSTON<br>

        <br>
        
        Althea Cooms-Thurston, one of the promising writers of the younger set
        of American dramatists, was born in Iowa, but soon moved with her
        parents to Colorado, where she spent her girlhood. She was educated in
        the public schools of Colorado Springs and Denver. Her collegiate
        training was received in the University of Utah, Salt Lake City. In 1902
        she married Walter R. Thurston, a well-known engineer. At present she
        resides in Dallas, Texas. <br>

        <br>

        
        Mrs. Thurston has travelled widely and has resided for periods of time
        in Mexico City and Havana, Cuba. She is an able linguist and has made a
        special study of her native English tongue and of Spanish and French,
        all of which she uses fluently. <br>

        <br>
    
        
        From childhood she has shown dramatic ability. Her dramatic composition
        has been more or less directly associated with the courses in
        playwriting and the history of the drama which she completed in the
        University of Utah. Among her one-act plays are _When a Man's Hungry_,
        _And the Devil Laughs_, and _The Exchange_. <br>
        
        <br>

        Mrs. Thurston has an aptitude for delicate and satirical farce. _The
        Exchange_ is an excellent example of farce-comedy in the contemporary
        one-act play. <br>

        CHARACTERS<br>

        <br>
        
            JUDGE, _the exchanger of miseries_<br>
            IMP, _office boy to the_ JUDGE<br>
            A POOR MAN <br>
            A VAIN WOMAN<br>
            A RICH CITIZEN<br>
        
        <br>
        
        THE EXCHANGE[C] <br>

        <br>
        
        
        SCENE I <br>

        <br>

             _The curtain rises upon an office scene. Seemingly there is nothing
             unusual about this office: it has tables, chairs, a filing cabinet,
             and a hat-rack. A portion of the office is railed off at the right.
             Within this enclosed space is a commodious desk and swivel-chair;
             and the filing cabinet stands against the wall. This railed-off
             portion of the office belongs, exclusively, to the_ JUDGE. _Here he
             is wont to spend many hours--sometimes to read or write, and again,
             perhaps, he will just sit and ponder upon the vagaries of mankind.
             The_ JUDGE _is a tall, spare man with rather long gray hair, which
             shows beneath the skull-cap that he always wears. When we first see
             him, he is reading a letter, and evidently he is not pleased, for
             he is tapping with impatient fingers upon his desk._ <br>

        <br>

             _At the left of the stage is a heavily curtained door which leads
             to an inner room. At centre rear is another door which evidently
             leads to the street, as it is through this door that the_ POOR MAN,
             _the_ VAIN WOMAN, _and the_ RICH CITIZEN _will presently enter,
             each upon his special quest. The hat-rack stands near the street
             door, and we glimpse a soft black hat and a long black overcoat
             hanging upon it._ <br>

        <br>

             _Down stage to the left is a flat-topped desk, littered with papers
             and letters. This desk has two large drawers, wherein a number of
             miscellaneous articles might be kept. It is at this desk that we
             catch our first glimpse of_ IMP. _He is busily writing in a huge
             ledger, and he seems to be enjoying his work, for he chuckles the
             while._ IMP _is a little rogue; he looks it and acts it, and we
             feel that he has a Mephistophelian spirit. He wears a dark-green
             tight-fitting uniform, trimmed with red braid. His saucy little
             round cap is always cocked over one eye. He is ever chuckling
             impishly, and we feel that he is slyly gleeful over the weaknesses
             of mankind and the difficulties that beset them._ <br>
        
        <br>

        IMP. [_Throws down his pen, chuckles, and half standing on the rungs of
        his chair and balancing himself against his desk, surveys the ledger._]
        Your honor, I've all the miseries listed to date and a fine lot there is
        to choose from. Everything from bunions to old wives for exchange. <br>

        <br>

        
        JUDGE. [_Scowls and impatiently taps the letter he is reading._] Here is
        another one. A woman suspects her husband of a misalliance. Wants to
        catch him, but is so crippled with rheumatism she can't get about. Wants
        us to exchange her rheumatism for something that won't interfere with
        either her walking or her eyesight. <br>


        <br>

        IMP. [_Referring to the ledger and running his finger along the lines._]
        We have a defective heart or a lazy liver that we could give her. <br>

        <br>


        JUDGE. [_Irritably tossing the letter over to_ IMP.] She would not be
        satisfied. People never are. They always want to change their miseries,
        but never their vices. Each thinks his own cross heavier than others
        have to bear, but he is very willing to make light of his own weaknesses
        and shortcomings. He thinks they are not half so bad as his neighbor's.
        I have tried for years to aid distressed humanity, but I can't satisfy
        them. I am growing tired of it all, Imp. People need a lesson and
        they're going to get it, too. I am going to---- <br>

        <br>


             [_Knock is heard at the street door._ JUDGE _sighs, turns to his
             desk and begins to write_. IMP _sweeps the litter of papers on his
             desk into a drawer, closes ledger, and goes to answer knock_. <br>

        <br>

        IMP. Here comes another misery.
        
             [IMP _opens the door to admit the_ POOR MAN, _who is very shabbily
             dressed. He hesitates, looks around the room as if he were in the
             wrong place, and then addresses_ IMP _in a loud whisper_. <br>

        <br>

        POOR MAN. [_Indicating the_ JUDGE _with a motion of his head_.] Is that
        him? <br>


        <br>


        IMP. [_Whispering loudly his reply._] Yes, that is his honor. <br>

        <br>

        POOR MAN. [_Still whispering and showing signs of nervousness._] Do I
        dare speak to him? <br>
