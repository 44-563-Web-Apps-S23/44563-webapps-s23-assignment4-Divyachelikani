    <h6> THE EXCHANGE BY ALTHEA THURSTON </h6>


    <P> IMP. [_Throws down his pen, chuckles, and half standing on the rungs of
        his chair and balancing himself against his desk, surveys the ledger._]
        Your honor, I've all the miseries listed to date and a fine lot there is
        to choose from. Everything from bunions to old wives for exchange. <br>

        <br>

    
        JUDGE. [_Scowls and impatiently taps the letter he is reading._] Here is
        another one. A woman suspects her husband of a misalliance. Wants to
        catch him, but is so crippled with rheumatism she can't get about. Wants
        us to exchange her rheumatism for something that won't interfere with
        either her walking or her eyesight. <br>


        <br>

        IMP. [_Referring to the ledger and running his finger along the lines._]
        We have a defective heart or a lazy liver that we could give her. <br>

        <br>


        JUDGE. [_Irritably tossing the letter over to_ IMP.] She would not be
        satisfied. People never are. They always want to change their miseries,
        but never their vices. Each thinks his own cross heavier than others
        have to bear, but he is very willing to make light of his own weaknesses
        and shortcomings. He thinks they are not half so bad as his neighbor's.
        I have tried for years to aid distressed humanity, but I can't satisfy
        them. I am growing tired of it all, Imp. People need a lesson and
        they're going to get it, too. I am going to---- <br>

        <br>

        IMP. Here comes another misery.
        
             [IMP _opens the door to admit the_ POOR MAN, _who is very shabbily
             dressed. He hesitates, looks around the room as if he were in the
             wrong place, and then addresses_ IMP _in a loud whisper_.] <br>

        <br>

        POOR MAN. [_Indicating the_ JUDGE _with a motion of his head_.] Is that
        him? <br>


        <br>


        IMP. [_Whispering loudly his reply._] Yes, that is his honor. <br>

        <br>

        POOR MAN. [_Still whispering and showing signs of nervousness._] Do I
        dare speak to him? <br>
